ChatRoom is a client server based application that allows multiple clients to be created and lets them communicate with each other through the server. 
————————————
Setup:
make - makes files client.o and server.o for linux machine
make mac - makes files for OS X machine
./server.o 51717 - makes server with given address (51718, etc. to be used if issues arise)
./client.o localhost 51717 - makes client to server with given address (must match server address) (can use ip address to connect to server on different machine) (can make multiple clients using same command)
————————————
Server:
No input is necessary for the server, it simply serves as a place to monitor input from all clients. You will see Usernames and Messages being output in this terminal window.
Ctrl+C closes instance of Server. 
WARNING: Closing a Server instance before its Clients are closed may prevent you from running on same address. Either increment address by one or restart terminal
————————————
Client:
USERNAME
In order to start communicating, a username needs to be supplied. If must be no more than 20 characters and must be original (server checks for this). Once a valid username is supplied, a message will be displayed saying so. 
MESSAGES
To send messages to other clients, simply type the desired message in the terminal window. This will then be send to the server and distributed to other clients.
COMMANDS
Commands are messages that are not sent to other users and simply interact with the server. (See command list section below)
————————————
Command List: (UNIMPLEMENTED commands function as normal messages)
/help - displays all commands
/exit - exits from client instance
/msg [clientName] [message] - sends message only to specified user
/online- list all registered clients

-- WORK ON MAC ONLY -- 
/grpadd [group name] - creates a group
/grp [group name] [message] - sends a message to the group
/grpmem [group name] [clientName] - adds a client to the group
————————————
Each client server interaction runs on its own thread
All client credentials are stored in an array of structs which is shared amongst the client threads
The client accout runs on two different threads one for reading and one for writing to the server
The group system stores all the group information in a array of structs (Group structs) which contains 
  the groups name, members (up to 5), and the number of members for sake of programming
